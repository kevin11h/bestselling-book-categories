Getting back to basics: Factors that make a book profitable
There are a few factors that make a book profitable, regardless of the niche. This isn’t rocket science, it’s pretty common sense if you think about it. Here are the factors I look for when scouting for books:

Good Price: First and foremost, you want to find books that are selling for a good price on Amazon – a price that offers a good profit margin. (A book scanner will tell you this info)

Low Supply: You also want books that have low supply (low competition) on the Amazon marketplace. You don’t want a book that has hundreds and hundreds of sellers, which can drive the market price down too quickly. (A book scanner will tell you this info)

High Demand: Obviously, you want books that have are in demand. You don’t want the opposite, where a book will sit on the shelf for months on end before it sells. If you use Amazon FBA, this will result in long-term storage fees, and if you do merchant fulfilled, this will result in diminishing space for new inventory. The way you measure demand, when selling books on Amazon, is by looking at the sales rank. It’s not a perfect metric, but it is the only thing we have and it can be fairly predictable. The lower the sales rank, the higher the demand (& the faster it will sell). (A book scanner will tell you this info)

Good Enough condition: What do I mean by “Good enough” condition? Well, with Amazon, even though you can list a book as “Acceptable” you don’t want to list books that are in really bad condition. Amazon buyers expect a certain level of quality.
